# Spacecraft SPA

Spacecraft SPA is a single-page application that displays information about various spacecraft.

## Installation

Single-page applications are easy to deploy. Just upload the files to any static content server and view ```index.html``` in your browser.

## Usage
Using Spacecraft SPA is very straightforward. When the page initially loads you will see two buttons in the header.

Click on "LAUNCH SPACECRAFT" to load images of and data about multiple spacecraft, active and inactive.

Click on "GIVE FEEDBACK" to view a feedback form and send us your thoughts about the page.
